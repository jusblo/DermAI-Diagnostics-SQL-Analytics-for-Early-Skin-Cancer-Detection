# DermAI-Diagnostics-SQL-Analytics-for-Early-Skin-Cancer-Detection
I built an end-to-end analytics project on 1,088 skin-lesion records to turn raw clinical data into KPIs, risk insights, and an actionable triage score for early detection.

ðŸ“Š KPIs & profiling: total lesions, median age, age-band mix, sex distribution, exposure prevalence.

ðŸ§© Risk analysis: malignancy by age/sex/exposures and lesion features (size, growth, bleeding, pain, itch, region).

ðŸ§ª Triage modeling (SQL): lightweight scoring that concentrates ~89% of cancers while reviewing ~46% of cases (NNB â‰ˆ 1.6).

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization: Excel/PowerPoint visuals beyond bars (100% stacked, slopegraph, dumbbell, lollipop, bubble matrix).

ðŸ›  Stack: PostgreSQL (window funcs/CTEs), Excel, PPT; clean, reproducible SQL scripts + slide assets.

âœ… Data practices: feature engineering (max diameter), stratified cuts, odds/risks, confounding checks (e.g., sewage access as equity metric, not a rule).

What this demonstrates: data wrangling, SQL analytics at scale, clear communication of results, and pragmatic decision support for cliniciansâ€”delivered as a polished, portfolio-ready project.
